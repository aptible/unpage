title: Third-party MCP Servers
---

The MCP plugin allows you to connect third-party MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
to your [Agents](/concepts/agents), enabling them to use tools, resources, and prompts
from external systems and services.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Features" icon="plug">
    - **Multiple Server Support**: Connect multiple MCP servers simultaneously
    - **Automatic Tool Routing**: Tools are automatically prefixed by server name to avoid conflicts
    - **Standard MCP Protocol**: Compatible with any MCP-compliant server
    - **Proxy Architecture**: Seamlessly integrates external tools into your agent workflows
  </Accordion>

## Configuration

Configure the MCP plugin by editing the `~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file.

Configuration follows the standard MCP server configuration format: each server under the `mcp_servers` key is a dictionary with the following keys, dependent on your chosen transport type:

### For stdio (i.e., local MCP servers)

- `command`: The command to run the MCP server
- `args`: The arguments to pass to the MCP server command
- `env`: The environment variables to set for the MCP server

```yaml
# ~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml

# ...

plugins:
  # ...
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      mcp_servers:
        git:
          command: "uvx"
          args: ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "/path/to/git/repo"]
          env:
            GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: "${GIT_USER_NAME:-Unpage}"  # Bash-like environment variable expansion

# ...
```

### For http (i.e., remote MCP servers)

- `transport`: The transport type of the MCP server (`http`, `streamable-http`, or `sse`)
- `url`: The URL to connect to the MCP server
- `auth`: The authentication to use for the MCP server (either a string representing a Bearer token, or "oauth" to use OAuth authentication)
- `headers`: The HTTP headers to send to the MCP server

```yaml
# ~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml

# ...

plugins:
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      mcp_servers:
        github:
          transport: "http"
          url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
          auth: "Bearer $GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
          headers:
            Authorization: "Bearer $GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"  # Bash-like environment variable expansion

# ...
```

## Tool Usage

Once configured, tools from MCP servers become available to your agents automatically.
Tools are prefixed with the server name to prevent conflicts:

- `mcp_git_log` - View git history (from git server)
- `mcp_filesystem_read_file` - Read file contents (from filesystem server)
- `mcp_github_create_issue` - Create GitHub issues (from github server)

## Example Agent Configuration

Use MCP tools in your [Unpage Agent](/concepts/agents) configurations:

```yaml
description: "Agent for code review and repository operations"
prompt: "You are a code review expert. Use git and filesystem tools to analyze code changes."

tools:
  - "mcp_git_*"                # All tools from git server
  - "mcp_filesystem_*"         # All tools from filesystem server
  - "mcp_github_create_issue"  # Specific tool from github server
```
