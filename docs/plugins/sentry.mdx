title: Sentry
---

The Sentry plugin integrates with [Sentry](https://sentry.io) by wrapping the official
[Sentry MCP server](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp), giving your
[Agents](/concepts/agents) access to Sentry issues, events, projects, and performance data.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP Tools" icon="wrench">
    The Sentry plugin provides access to all tools from the official Sentry MCP server,
    including:
    - Search and retrieve issues
    - Query events and error details
    - Access project information
    - Retrieve stack traces and error context
    - Performance monitoring data
    - And more...

    For a complete list of available tools, see the [Sentry MCP server documentation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp#features).

## Prerequisites

### For Remote Mode (Recommended)

No additional setup is required - the plugin will use Sentry's hosted MCP server with OAuth authentication.

### For Local Mode

You'll need:

- **Node.js and npm/npx**: Required to run the Sentry MCP server via npx
- **Sentry API Token**: An authentication token with appropriate permissions

#### Creating a Sentry API Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Sentry Settings">
    Go to your Sentry organization settings: `https://sentry.io/settings/[your-org]/auth-tokens/`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Token">
    Click "Create New Token" and grant the following scopes based on your needs:
    - `project:read` - Read project information
    - `event:read` - Read error events
    - `org:read` - Read organization data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Token">
    Copy the generated token - you'll need it for configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

Configure the Sentry plugin by running `uv run unpage configure` or by editing
the `~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file:

### Remote Mode (Recommended)

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  sentry:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      mode: "remote"
```

With remote mode, authentication is handled via OAuth when you first connect to the Sentry MCP server.

### Local Mode

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  sentry:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      mode: "local"
      sentry_token: "your-sentry-api-token"
```

Alternatively, you can set the Sentry token as an environment variable:

```bash
export SENTRY_TOKEN="your-sentry-api-token"
```

The plugin will automatically use the environment variable if no token is specified in the configuration file.

### Configuration Options

<ParamField path="mode" type="string" default="remote">
  The mode to run the Sentry MCP server in:
  - `remote`: Connect to Sentry's hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp` (recommended)
  - `local`: Run the Sentry MCP server locally using npx (`@sentry/mcp-server`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sentry_token" type="string">
  Your Sentry API token. Required only when `mode` is `local`. Can also be set via
  the `SENTRY_TOKEN` environment variable.
</ParamField>

## Tool Usage

Once configured, all tools from the Sentry MCP server become available to your agents,
prefixed with `sentry_`:

```yaml
# Example agent configuration
description: "Agent for Sentry error monitoring"
prompt: "You help investigate and resolve Sentry errors."

tools:
  - "sentry_*"  # All Sentry tools
```

Common tool patterns include:
- `sentry_search_issues` - Search for issues in Sentry
- `sentry_get_issue` - Get detailed information about a specific issue
- `sentry_get_events` - Retrieve events for an issue
- `sentry_list_projects` - List available projects
- And many more...

For a complete list of available tools and their parameters, refer to the
[Sentry MCP server documentation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp#features).

## Developing Agents

Your agents can leverage Sentry tools to automatically investigate errors, correlate
issues with infrastructure changes, analyze stack traces, and provide debugging insights.
Combine Sentry tools with other Unpage features like the [Knowledge Graph](/concepts/knowledge-graph),
[Metrics](/plugins/metrics), or [Logs](/plugins/datadog) for comprehensive incident response.

Learn more about [Creating Agents](/concepts/agents).

### Example Use Cases

- **Automated Error Triage**: Agents can automatically categorize and prioritize Sentry issues based on frequency, severity, and impact
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Combine Sentry error data with infrastructure metrics and logs to identify the root cause of issues
- **Alert Correlation**: Link Sentry issues to related infrastructure events in your knowledge graph
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track application performance metrics and identify bottlenecks
