The GitHub plugin integrates with [GitHub](https://github.com) by wrapping the official
[GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server), giving your
[Agents](/concepts/agents) access to GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP Tools" icon="wrench">
    The GitHub plugin provides access to all tools from the official GitHub MCP server,
    including:
    - Repository operations (clone, read files, search)
    - Issue management (create, update, search, comment)
    - Pull request operations (create, review, merge)
    - Branch and commit operations
    - And more...

    For a complete list of available tools, see the [GitHub MCP server documentation](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server#features).

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: A token with appropriate permissions for the operations you want to perform
- **Docker** (for local mode only): Docker must be installed and running if you choose to run the MCP server locally

### Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to GitHub Settings">
    Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate New Token">
    Click "Generate new token" (classic) or "Generate new token (fine-grained)" depending on your needs.

    For classic tokens, grant the following scopes based on your needs:
    - `repo` - Full control of private repositories
    - `read:org` - Read org and team membership
    - `user` - Read user profile data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Token">
    Copy the generated token - you'll need it for configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

Configure the GitHub plugin by running `uv run unpage configure` or by editing
the `~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  github:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      github_token: "your-github-personal-access-token"
      mode: "remote"  # or "local"
      read_only: true  # optional, defaults to true
```

Alternatively, you can set the GitHub token as an environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-github-personal-access-token"
```

The plugin will automatically use the environment variable if no token is specified in the configuration file.

### Configuration Options

<ParamField path="github_token" type="string" required>
  Your GitHub Personal Access Token. Can also be set via the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="mode" type="string" default="remote">
  The mode to run the GitHub MCP server in:
  - `remote`: Connect to GitHub's hosted MCP server at `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`
  - `local`: Run the GitHub MCP server locally using Docker (`ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="read_only" type="boolean" default="true">
  Whether to enable read-only mode. When `true`, agents can only read data from GitHub
  but cannot make modifications (create issues, merge PRs, etc.).
</ParamField>

## Tool Usage

Once configured, all tools from the GitHub MCP server become available to your agents,
prefixed with `github_`:

```yaml
# Example agent configuration
description: "Agent for GitHub operations"
prompt: "You help manage GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests."

tools:
  - "github_*"  # All GitHub tools
```

Common tool patterns include:
- `github_search_repositories` - Search for repositories
- `github_create_issue` - Create a new issue
- `github_create_pull_request` - Create a pull request
- `github_get_file_contents` - Read file contents from a repository
- And many more...

For a complete list of available tools and their parameters, refer to the
[GitHub MCP server documentation](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server#features).

## Developing Agents

Your agents can leverage GitHub tools to automate repository operations, manage issues
and pull requests, analyze code, and more. Combine GitHub tools with other Unpage
features like the [Knowledge Graph](/concepts/knowledge-graph), [Metrics](/plugins/metrics),
or [Shell Commands](/plugins/shell) for powerful automation workflows.
