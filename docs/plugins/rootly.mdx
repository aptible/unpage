Our Rootly integration allows [Agents](/concepts/agents) to learn about, filter, and
take action on incidents happening in your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

To configure the Rootly integration you'll need to generate a Rootly API key.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your Rootly Organization Settings">
    In the Rootly UI, navigate to your organization settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Token">
    Go to "Organization Settings > API Keys" and create a new token with the necessary permissions for incident management.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Configuration
Configure the Rootly plugin by running `uv run unpage configure` or by editing
the `~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  rootly:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      api_key: <your api key> # required
```

Alternatively, you can set the `ROOTLY_API_KEY` environment variable.


## Developing Agents
Your Agents can react to Rootly incidents by adding context from your
[Knowledge Graph](/concepts/knowledge-graph), pulling [Metrics](/plugins/metrics),
or running custom [Shell Commands](/plugins/shell).

Learn more about [Creating Agents](/concepts/agents).

### Running Locally
You can test your Agents locally on past or current Rootly incidents by
passing in a Rootly incident ID or URL to `unpage agent run`:

```bash
uv run unpage agent run <agent_name> --rootly-incident 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
```

You can also use a full Rootly incident URL:

```bash
uv run unpage agent run <agent_name> --rootly-incident https://app.rootly.com/incidents/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
```

Alternatively, you can use the interactive quickstart to select from recent incidents:

```bash
uv run unpage agent quickstart
```

Unpage will fetch the incident automatically and send it to your Agent. The
Agent thought process, tool calls, and output will be printed to `stdout`.

### Webhooks
Agent workflows can run automatically by configuring Rootly to send webhooks
to your [Unpage Server](/commands/agent#subcommand%3A-serve).

Configure your Rootly webhooks to send incident events to your Unpage Server
endpoint at `/webhook` (like `https://unpage.yourdomain.com/webhook`).

During development you can tunnel to your local Unpage instance using ngrok by
running `uv run unpage agent serve --tunnel` (see [Unpage Server](/commands/agent#subcommand%3A-serve)
for details).

Unpage will now receive webhooks from Rootly and send them to the
[Router](/concepts/router), which will decide which [Agent](/concepts/agents) workflow to run.
