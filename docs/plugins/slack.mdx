The Slack plugin allows [Agents](/concepts/agents) to post messages to Slack channels using incoming webhooks. This enables agents to send notifications, alerts, and incident updates directly to your team's Slack workspace.

  <Accordion title="MCP Tools" icon="wrench">
    - **slack_post_to_[channel_name]**: Post messages to configured Slack channels (one tool per configured channel)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prerequisites

To configure the Slack integration, you'll need to create an incoming webhook for each Slack channel you want to post to.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your Slack workspace settings">
    Navigate to your Slack workspace and click on your workspace name in the top-left corner, then select "Settings & administration" > "Manage apps".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Incoming Webhooks">
    Search for "Incoming Webhooks" in the app directory and click "Add to Slack" (or "Add" if already installed).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the webhook">
    Select the channel where you want to receive notifications and click "Add Incoming Webhooks integration".

    Copy the webhook URL - it should look like:
    ```
    https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize (optional)">
    You can customize the webhook name and icon in the Slack settings, but Unpage can also set these when posting messages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

Configure the Slack plugin by running `uv run unpage configure` or by editing the `~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  slack:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      channels:
        - name: incidents
          description: Post incident updates and alerts
          webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
        - name: alerts
          description: Post monitoring alerts
          webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/OTHER/WEBHOOK/URL
```

Each channel creates a corresponding MCP tool that agents can use. For example, the `incidents` channel above creates a tool called `slack_post_to_incidents`.

## Developing Agents

Your agents can post messages to Slack channels as part of their incident response workflows. Messages can include enriched context from your [Knowledge Graph](/concepts/knowledge-graph), results from [Metrics](/plugins/metrics) queries, or output from [Shell Commands](/plugins/shell).

Learn more about [Creating Agents](/concepts/agents).

### Configuration During Setup

When you run `uv run unpage configure`, you'll be prompted to set up one Slack webhook interactively. For additional channels, edit the `config.yaml` file directly and add more entries to the `channels` list.

### Testing Locally

You can test your agents locally to verify they can post to Slack:

```bash
uv run unpage agent run <agent_name>
```

The agent will post test messages to your configured Slack channels according to its defined behavior.

## Tools

The Slack plugin dynamically creates tools based on your configured channels. Each channel gets its own tool:

<Card title="slack_post_to_[channel_name]">
  Post a message to the configured Slack channel.

  **Arguments**
  <ParamField path="message" type="string" required>
    The message to post to the Slack channel. Supports plain text and basic formatting.
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="username" type="string">
    Username to display for the message. Defaults to "Unpage".
  </ParamField>

  **Returns** `string`: Success or error message.
</Card>

## Example

See our complete [Slack notification example](/examples/slack_notifications) for a full walkthrough of setting up an agent that posts enriched incident alerts to Slack.
