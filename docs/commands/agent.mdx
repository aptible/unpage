## Subcommand: create

Creates a new agent configuration file based on available templates and opens it in your default editor.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent create [OPTIONS] AGENT_NAME
```

### Options

## Subcommand: delete

Deletes an existing agent.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent delete [OPTIONS] AGENT_NAME
```

## Subcommand: edit

Opens an existing agent configuration file in your default editor.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent edit [OPTIONS] AGENT_NAME
```

## Subcommand: list

Lists all available agents in your Unpage instance.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent list [OPTIONS]
```

## Subcommand: quickstart

Launches an interactive wizard to quickly set up an incident response agent.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent quickstart [OPTIONS]
```

## Subcommand: route

Tests which agent would be selected to analyze a given payload based on your routing configuration.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent route [OPTIONS] [PAYLOAD]
```

## Subcommand: run

Executes an agent with a provided payload and displays the analysis.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent run [OPTIONS] AGENT_NAME [PAYLOAD]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--profile TEXT` | Use profiles to manage multiple graphs [env var: UNPAGE_PROFILE] [default: default] |
| `--debug` | Enable debug mode to print the history of the agent |
| `--pagerduty-incident TEXT` | PagerDuty incident ID or URL to use instead of payload or stdin |
| `--rootly-incident TEXT` | Rootly incident ID or URL to use instead of payload or stdin |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message and exit |

### Examples: Running an Agent with a Test Payload

```shell
# Run an agent with a JSON payload from a file
unpage agent run my-agent @path/to/payload.json

# Run an agent with a JSON payload provided directly
unpage agent run my-agent '{"alert": "Disk usage exceeds 80%"}'
```


## Subcommand: schedule

Starts the agent scheduler daemon, which runs agents on a periodic schedule according to their cron expressions. This enables "background chores" like cost optimization reports, security audits, and other maintenance tasks that should run automatically on a schedule.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent schedule [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--profile TEXT` | Use profiles to manage multiple configurations [env var: UNPAGE_PROFILE] [default: default] |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message and exit |

### Configuring Scheduled Agents

To schedule an agent, add a `schedule` section to your agent YAML file with a cron expression:

```yaml
description: Run monthly cost optimization checks

schedule:
  cron: "0 10 2 * *"  # At 10:00 AM on the 2nd day of every month

prompt: >
  Analyze infrastructure costs and identify optimization opportunities.
  Use available tools to get cost data and generate recommendations.

tools:
  - "aws_*"
  - "graph_*"
```

<Note>
Scheduled agents run with no input payload, so make sure your agent prompt specifies how to get any required inputs (e.g., via tool calls).
</Note>

### Cron Expression Format

The cron expression uses the standard 5-field format:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Examples

```shell
# Start the scheduler (runs all agents with schedules)
unpage agent schedule

# Common cron patterns:
# "0 * * * *"      - Every hour at minute 0
# "0 0 * * *"      - Daily at midnight
# "0 0 * * 0"      - Weekly on Sunday at midnight
# "0 0 1 * *"      - Monthly on the 1st at midnight
# "0 9 * * 1-5"    - Weekdays at 9 AM
# "*/15 * * * *"   - Every 15 minutes
```

### Scheduler Functionality

When running, the scheduler:

1. Loads all agents from your profile that have a `schedule` configuration
2. Sets up cron jobs for each scheduled agent
3. Runs agents automatically according to their schedules
4. Logs the output of each agent run

Press Ctrl+C to stop the scheduler.

## Subcommand: serve

Starts the Unpage Agent server, which listens for incoming alerts and routes them to appropriate agents. This creates a webhook receiver that can process alerts from various systems (like PagerDuty) and intelligently selects the most appropriate agent to analyze them.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent serve [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--host TEXT` | 127.0.0.1 | The host to bind to |
| `--port INTEGER` | 8000 | The port to bind to |
| `--workers INTEGER` | 1 | The number of workers to use |
| `--profile TEXT` | default | The profile to use for configuration |
| `--reload / --no-reload` | False | Reload the server when code changes |
| `--tunnel / --no-tunnel` | False | Tunnel the server through ngrok for external access |
| `--ngrok-token TEXT` | From env var | The ngrok token for tunneling |
| `--ngrok-domain TEXT` | None | The ngrok domain for tunneling |

### Server Functionality

When running, the agent server:

1. Exposes a `/webhook` endpoint that receives alert payloads as JSON via POST requests
2. Automatically selects the most appropriate agent based on the incoming payload
3. Processes the alert using the agent's configuration and LLM capabilities
4. Returns an analysis of the alert

### Examples

```shell
# Start the agent server with default settings (localhost:8000)
unpage agent serve

# Start the server on a custom host and port
unpage agent serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000

# Start the server with hot-reloading for development
unpage agent serve --reload

# Start the server and expose it externally using ngrok
unpage agent serve --tunnel --ngrok-token your_ngrok_token
```

## Subcommand: templates

Lists all available agent templates that can be used when creating a new agent.

### Usage

```shell
unpage agent templates [OPTIONS]
```
