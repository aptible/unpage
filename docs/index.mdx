## Intro

Unpage is the open source framework for building SRE agents with infrastructure context and secure access to any dev tool. With Unpage, you can reduce alert noise, automate incident investigation, and build custom agents to handle specific tasks that would otherwise require an SRE.

## Unpage Agents

Unpage agents are defined in natural language in YAML files. This is an example agent that investigates CPU alerts and provides a summary on the incident:

```yaml expandable
#cpu-alert-agent.yaml

#description: used by the router to determine which agent to use for the alert
description: >
	Use this agent...

#prompt: instructions for the agent to follow when acting on the alert
prompt: >
	...

#tools:
tools: >
	...
```

**Description**: When Unpage is running and receives an incident payload from your alerting tool, the router uses the agent description to determine which agent should act on the incident. Learn more about **Unpage's router here**.

**Prompt:** The selected agent will follow the investigation steps listed in the prompt. This will often resemble a runbook for the type of alert.

```yaml
#it would be cool to show a runbook side-by-side 
#with what the agent prompt looks like
```

**Tools**: In order to do its investigation, the agent uses tools to understand your infrastructure and connect to your alerting tool. You can limit the tools that the agent has access to by specifying them here. 

Learn more about connecting **plugins and tools** here. 

**Response:** In this case, the CPU alert agent will leave a comment on the incident like this:

```yaml
#agent response here
```

You can customize your agents to automatically respond to different types of alerts and take different actions to address them. See more **examples here**. 

To create your first agent, **install Unpage** and run Quickstart:

```shellscript
#Install Unpage
curl -fsSL https://unpage.ai/install.sh | bash
```

```shellscript
#Quickstart
uvx unpage agent quickstart
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- `uv` package manager
- API keys for [your LLM](/plugins/llm) and alerting, infrastructure, and observability tools. Learn more in [Plugins](/concepts/plugins).

### Install uv

On macOS:

```shell
brew install uv
```

For other platforms, follow the [official uv installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

### Install Unpage

Unpage is designed to be run using `uvx`, which comes with `uv`:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://unpage.ai/install.sh | bash
```

## ~~Quickstart~~

~~To get started, run:~~

```shell
uvx unpage agent quickstart
```

~~This will get you up and running with your first agent, which will automatically investigate and add context to alerts from ~~[~~PagerDuty~~](/plugins/pagerduty)~~ (or your preferred alerting provider). You will also have a chance to set up your infrastructure knowledge graph to provide your agent with more context.~~

~~The quickstart flow will walk you through:~~

- ~~Configuring ~~[~~your LLM~~](/plugins/llm)~~, ~~[~~PagerDuty plugin~~](/plugins/pagerduty)~~, and logs and metrics plugins~~
- ~~Creating your first ~~[~~agent~~](/concepts/agents)~~ and prompt~~
- ~~Testing your agent with an existing incident ticket~~
- ~~Building your ~~[~~knowledge graph~~](/concepts/knowledge-graph)

## ~~Running the Agent~~

~~Once you're happy with the results of your agent, you can automate the agent's actions for new incidents by running ~~`unpage agent serve`~~and configuring ~~ [~~PagerDuty to send webhooks~~](/plugins/pagerduty#webhooks)~~ to the Unpage server:~~

```shell
uvx unpage agent serve -h
```

~~The ~~`agent serve`~~command supports running the server over an ngrok tunnel, so that you can test your agents end-to-end locally, without deploying. For more information on ~~ `agent serve`~~options, see ~~ [~~its documentation~~](/commands/agent#subcommand%3A-serve)~~.~~

## ~~Maintenance~~

### ~~Update Configuration~~

~~If you need to add or update plugins or API keys, you can update your configuration with:~~

```shell
uvx unpage configure
```

### ~~Update the Knowledge Graph~~

~~To refresh your knowledge graph to give your agent up-to-date information, run:~~

```shell
uvx unpage graph build -h
```

### ~~Add More Context~~

~~Your agent's responses will improve with more context about your infrastructure, which can be provided via the knowledge graph or custom scripts. To provide your agents with more context in addition to the knowledge graph, see ~~[~~Shell Commands~~](/plugins/shell)~~.~~

### ~~Create Agents~~

~~See ~~[~~Agents~~](/concepts/agents)~~ to learn more about how to create and edit your agents and prompts.~~
