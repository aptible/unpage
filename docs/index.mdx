title: "Getting Started with Unpage"

<Info>
  **ALPHA SOFTWARE**: Unpage is experimental, under heavy development, and may be unstable. Use at your own risk\!
</Info>

### Intro

At the end of this guide, you will have Unpage set up to run locally with built-in integrations and tools, a knowledge graph, and your first infrastructure-aware agent.

### How Unpage works

TODO

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.12 or higher
- `uv` package manager
- API keys for your LLM and alerting, infrastructure, and observability tools. See more in Plugins.

### **Installation**

Unpage is designed to be run using `uvx`, which comes with `uv`:

```
uvx unpage
```

### **Quickstart**

To get started, run:

```
uvx run unpage agent quickstart
```

This will get you up and running with your first agent, which will automatically investigate and add context to alerts from PagerDuty (or your preferred alerting provider). You will also have a chance to set up your infrastructure knowledge graph to provide your agent with more context.

The quickstart flow will walk you through:

- Configuring your LLM, PagerDuty plugin, and logs and metrics plugins
- Creating your first agent and prompt
- Testing your agent with an existing incident ticket
- Building your knowledge graph

### Configure

If you need to add or update plugins or API keys, you can update your configuration with:

```
uvx unpage configure
```

### Add Context

Your agent's responses will improve with more context about your infrastructure, which can be provided via the knowledge graph or custom scripts. To provide your agents with more context in addition to the knowledge graph, see [Shell Commands](/docs/reference/shell).

### Create Agents
