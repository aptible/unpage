MLflow is an expansive platform to build AI applications and models. We use a sliver of it that provides a tracing UI for LLM agents.

## Setting Up MLflow

Use Unpage's built-in tracing to monitor agent execution:

```bash
unpage mlflow serve
```

## Running Unpage and Capturing Traces

Unpage will automatically send traces to the MLflow server when the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable is set.

```bash
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5566 unpage agent run
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5566 unpage agent serve
```

View execution traces at `${MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}/#/experiments/1?searchFilter=&orderByKey=attributes.start_time&orderByAsc=false&startTime=ALL&lifecycleFilter=Active&modelVersionFilter=All+Runs&datasetsFilter=W10%3D&compareRunsMode=TRACES` to see:
- Tool usage patterns
- Execution timing
- Error rates and types
- Agent decision flows

The default MLflow server will have traces at: `http://127.0.0.1:5566/#/experiments/1?searchFilter=&orderByKey=attributes.start_time&orderByAsc=false&startTime=ALL&lifecycleFilter=Active&modelVersionFilter=All+Runs&datasetsFilter=W10%3D&compareRunsMode=TRACES`
